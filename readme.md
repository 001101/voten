# [Voten.co](https://voten.co)

[Voten.co](https://voten.co) is an open-source, beautiful, highly customizable yet deadly simple, and warm community. To get a quick taste of what Voten is written with please check our [credits page](https://voten.co/credits).

## Update:

I currently don't have the time that is required to maintain Voten. I am however open to contract work in case you need help with developing your fork of Voten, or any other development gig. You can reach me at algo@hey.com

My new open-source project is [Jesse](https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse), an advanced cryptocurrency algo-trading framework written in Python.
